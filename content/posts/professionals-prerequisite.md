The most crucial prerequisite one should fulfill before attempting to walk the professional's path, is the ability to put in an immense amount of time and dedication. I've known this since.. forever, yet, I've always had trouble achieving this. I'd sit down to study for 3 hours, tops, then move on to do (more like not do) something else. That drove me crazy - why could I not pull off at least an 8 hour long programming session, like, say, [Gamozo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YAgDJTs9So)? In this post, I'll write about my blockade and how I've managed to remove it.

## Getting Off of Useless Platforms
I noticed I was spending way too much time on platforms like Youtube, Reddit, and Twitter. I could remember days when I spent *at least* five hours in total on Youtube, just watching random videos. I finally decided to use a site-blocker browser extension to block them. Let's talk about these platforms.

### Youtube
This is a site filled with random videos, from ones like game or movie reviews, politics, general science & technology, to programming & hacking videos. All equally useless. From my personal experience, I can hardly recall information and details from these videos, and the entertainment I get from some of them is "meh". It's just not a proper way of learning anything. Youtube, for me, became a site for excessive escapism and severe procrastination.

### Twitter
You will mostly come across useless tweets, and only rarely come across some links to useful blogposts. It can also contain not-so-rare toxicity, which is meant to trigger you into tweeting, and staying on the site. It also has a fake "New Tweets" button that appears on the top of your screen every now and then, when in truth, it just recycles posts from 12 hours before. Also a procrastination tool.

### Reddit
You will find *some* useful stuff there, but it's mainly a hive-mind. It shoves politics at you even if you don't want it to. You will consistently encounter toxicity there as well. It is no place to learn new things in any meaningful way. If you want to read people's one-sided, emotionally-loaded arguments, and waste your time on that - go ahead. I don't.

All of these platforms have 2 things in common. The first, is that they all have this algorithm which was *engineered* on the purpose of luring you in for as much time as possible. The second, is that it's difficult to learn anything of substance from them.

The conclusion is easy. These are useless, toxic, predatory platforms, and were obviously not designed with good intention.

## Getting Along Without Them
If I want to listen to music, I now exclusively use spotify. If there's a podcast I wanna listen to, I'll first check if it's there. If I still need to watch a Youtube video for whatever reason, I use my phone (which I'd otherwise keep in the far corner of my room while studying). If I have to use the PC, I can temporarily remove the blockade and bring it back immediately after watching that specific video I wanted.

If I want to research some topic, like Crypto & Web3, Climate Change, Renewable Energy, etc, I don't use Youtube. I read blogposts, articles, noob-friendly academic papers. I make sure I read *different opinions* and compare between them. This isn't a burden - it serves me, I can now form my own opinions much more maturely. You **don't** get that with Youtube.

If I need to be updated about new blogposts in my niche, I go over a list of blogs I made, to check for new posts, for example:
- [The Windows Internals Blog](https://windows-internals.com/pages/internals-blog/)
- [Secret Club](https://secret.club/)
- [Back Engineering](https://back.engineering/)

If I need some video game guide I won't use Reddit, I'll probaly use some article, or join that game's Discord server and ask people.

## Reaping the Benefits
Now that the distractions are gone, and my attention span is improving, I can gradually put more and more hours into the field. No need for a fake-as-hell (and unrealistic) morning routine, no "micro time management" or whatever the hell it means, no "[insert productivity video title here]" bullsh!t. All it took was one browser extension.

It even goes a little beyond that. The internet feels a little old-school again, it feels right again! Mainly static websites, mainly me just looking for knowledge or useful forums and documents, no toxic culture wars which aren't related to me in any way. I'm more emtionally balanced. I can research topics much better and more maturely.

**I feel I'm in balance.**
